The provided dataset contains various information about properties, including their addresses, locations, and transaction details. It is essential for a dataset consumer to understand the context and purpose of the data to avoid any potential misuse or harm.

Firstly, the dataset may not be comprehensive as it only covers a specific time period and geographical area. This could lead to biased conclusions if used for broader analyses or comparisons. To mitigate this risk, a dataset consumer should ensure that the data is representative and covers a diverse range of properties and locations.

Secondly, the dataset may contain sensitive information, such as postcodes and transaction details. It is crucial to handle this data responsibly and securely to avoid any privacy breaches or discrimination. A dataset consumer should ensure that they have the necessary permissions and follow appropriate data protection regulations when using this information.

Thirdly, the dataset may not include all relevant factors that could impact the value or quality of a property.
