5. Correct errors: Once you've identified the source of an error, you can correct it. This may involve updating the dataset with the correct information, removing the erroneous data, or applying a transformation to the data to correct inconsistencies.

6. Validate: After making corrections, validate the dataset to ensure that the changes have not introduced new errors. This may involve re-analyzing the data, cross-referencing with other sources, or conducting a thorough review of the dataset.

7. Document: Keep a record of any errors you've identified and the steps you've taken to correct them. This documentation can be valuable for future reference and can help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.

In summary, while I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether there is an erratum in the dataset without more information, following these general steps can help you identify and correct potential errors in your data.

As a Data Curator, it's important to maintain the quality and accuracy of your datasets to ensure that they are reliable and useful for analysis and decision-making. Regularly reviewing and validating your data is a key part of this process.
