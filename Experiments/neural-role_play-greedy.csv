The data associated with each instance was likely collected through various methods. Some of the statistics, like at bats, hits, and home runs, are directly observable as they are the results of actual baseball games. Other data, such as batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage, are calculated based on the observed data. These calculations are done using standard formulas and are considered valid and reliable within the context of baseball statistics.

For some data points, like intentional walks, hit by pitch, and sacrifice flies, they are reported by the umpires and recorded by the official scorers during the game. These data points are also considered valid as they are directly observed and documented by the game officials.

As for the data that is indirectly inferred or derived from other data, such as weighted on-base average, weighted runs created, and weighted runs created percentage, they are calculated using advanced statistical models and algorithms. These calculations are based on the observed data and are designed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a player's overall performance. The validity of these derived data points depends on the accuracy and reliability of the underlying data and the quality of the algorithms used for their calculation.
